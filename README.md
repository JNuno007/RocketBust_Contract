# RocketBust_Contract

## Resume
This is a smart contract built for the Lamden blockchain, developed in Python.
It is meant to be a contract for a game where users bet an amount of TAU (Lamden token) trying to guess if a certain number will be surpassed or not. If it does, the profit is the amount betted times the number.

## Development
The contract is developed in Python using the Contracting library, written by the Lamden Team, you can check it here, [Contracting](https://developers.lamden.io/contracting/)
This contract is submited into the Lamden blockchain through the Wallet Chrome Extension.

On the front-end we have Lamden-JS library where we can interact with wallets and connect them with the smart contract, you can follow the documentation through [here](https://developers.lamden.io/lamden-js/)
